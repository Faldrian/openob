h1. OpenOB

OpenOB (Open Outside Broadcast) is a simple Python/GStreamer based application which implements a highly configurable RTP-based audio link system.

It is intended to allow professional broadcasters to avoid expensive 'codec' hardware, which is typically costed based on quality - you pay a premium for better quality or lower latencies. OpenOB supports Opus, a high-quality efficient low-latency codec, and allows you to run all of this off commodity computer hardware at much much lower cost, lowering the bar to entry for broadcasters, allowing professional quality contribution links to be set up with nothing more than an entry-level computer at each end.

While outside broadcast contribution links are the primary use-case, the system is also usable for other tasks requiring a high-reliability audio link, such as studio-studio links and studio-transmitter links.

h2. Development Status

OpenOB is stable and suitable for production usage.

If you intend to put it into production, test thoroughly before doing so, as with any other system you might deploy.

h2. Technical Information

OpenOB is a single program which can be run as a transmitter or receiver. It is configured by command-line options.

By default the Opus codec is used for audio transport. This is a codec equally suited to music as it is to speech, and which is very bandwidth efficient, allowing good quality links at as low as 16 or 32kbps with very high quality links at 96kbps and above. It's also patent-free and unencumbered. Opus' predecessor, CELT, is also available for legacy systems.

Additionally, OpenOB can move raw little-endian PCM 16-bit audio around, allowing for entirely transparent lossless audio links for studio-transmitter links or OBs where a high quality link is available.

The actual network protocol used to move audio is the Real Time Protocol. OpenOB also supports RTCP and the RTCP Sender Report protocol, though only at the gstreamer level - nothing currently makes use of RTCP SRs within OpenOB itself.

Audio level monitoring is provided via simple printouts at each end for easy debugging. Network failures are recovered from automatically. Level monitoring of each end along with timestamps are provided bidirectionally for debugging and monitoring, so you can easily see what's going on at each end.

Latency is by default configured limited on jitter buffer size with a 150ms buffer, which works well on congested switched networks with no QoS. 10ms and lower are possible on suitable hardware with a suitable connection.

h2. Usage/Installation

h3. Non-Python Dependencies

To install dependencies on an Ubuntu box you can run the following:

<pre>sudo apt-get install python-gst0.10 python-setuptools gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad \ 
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly \
gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-tools python-gobject python-gobject-2 gstreamer0.10-alsa </pre>

You'll need two Python libraries; on 12.04 these can be fetched as packages but prior versions need the latest versions, so use easy_install (installed with python-setuptools above):

<pre>sudo easy_install redis;sudo easy_install argparse</pre>

On Debian Wheezy and later you should be able to just run the following:

<pre>sudo apt-get install python-gst0.10 python-setuptools gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad \ 
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-tools \
python-gobject python-gobject-2 gstreamer0.10-alsa python-redis python-argparse</pre>

You will also need to install Redis on a machine - it does not need to be on the receiver or transmitter, but the receiver machine is probably where you want to put it.
 
<pre>sudo apt-get install redis-server</pre>

You then need to edit /etc/redis/redis.conf and instruct redis to bind to your external IP address or 0.0.0.0, then restart redis.

h3. Installing

<pre>sudo easy_install OpenOB</pre>

That's it!

You can now run OpenOB. @openob -h@ will list help; @openob dummyhost someconfig rx -h@ will give help for the receiver mode, for instance.

h2. Dependencies

* Linux (Ubuntu Server/Desktop tested)
* gstreamer 0.10, plus plugins (alsasrc/jackaudiosrc, opusenc and rtpopuspay/rtpL16pay bins required - install good, bad and ugly packages, plus any gstreamer-alsa packages for your distro)
* Python 2.7 or lower (3.x tentatively supported)
* Python gstreamer bindings
* Python redis bindings
* Python gobject bindings
* JACK server (optionally, ALSA is fine though)
* Redis server (only needed on the configuration server, usually configured on the receiver)

h2. Troubleshooting

h3. Redis Unreachable

<pre> -- Unable to configure myself from the configuration host; has the transmitter been started yet? (Error 111 connecting some-address:6379. Connection refused.)</pre>

This tends to mean your RX can't talk to Redis. Check you've edited /etc/redis/redis.conf to either comment out the bind 127.0.0.1 default or set bind to your public IP, then restart Redis. You may also have a firewall issue - ensure TCP port 6379 is open.

h3. Silence/-700 level

Check your sound card with alsaconfig, and ensure you're passing the right device (arecord -l to get a list) to OpenOB.

h2. Real-World Users

This list is new; if you're using OpenOB in the real world (or testing/developing with it/evaluating it), let me know so you can be added to the list (or just add yourself in a fork and throw in a pull request).
