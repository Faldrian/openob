OpenOB - Open Audio over IP for Broadcasters
============================================

The OpenOB project is an audio over IP software package designed for broadcast engineers and system integrators at broadcasters. 

The goal of the project is to provide a simple framework for configuring and managing quasi-real-time (<30ms latency) audio streams between devices over standard IP networks, which can be extended to support more complex configurations such as talkback links or high reliability configurations.

OpenOB can be used for:

* Studio to studio contribution links
* Outside broadcast contribution links
* Studio to transmitter distribution links

It can be used on a variety of network connections, with operating bitrates as low as 16kbps in compressed mode, and support for fully lossless operation in linear PCM mode.

History 
=======

OpenOB was developed by James Harrison at Insanity Radio, a London based community radio station, as a studio-transmitter link. 

It was later developed into a more generic tool and published. It is now in regular use in a number of community radio stations in the UK and abroad, and continues to be developed and expanded.
