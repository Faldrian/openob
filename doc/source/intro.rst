Introduction
============

OpenOB is an audio over IP (AoIP) transciever tool that can manage establishment and recovery of AoIP links in a low overhead manner.

It supports lossless linear PCM audio as well as the Opus audio codec for compressed audio operation. It is designed to operate as a standalone tool, but is also straightforward to use in your own projects, such as for building AoIP hardware.
